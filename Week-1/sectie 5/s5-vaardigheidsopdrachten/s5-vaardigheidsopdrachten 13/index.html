            <h2>So, there are three messages in Hello Kitty. First is, you should be loved, and you need to be nice to others to be loved. And the ribbon represents human connections. We should get along with one another. Also, having no mouth means we need to express with our actions not only by words. Those are the meanings.</h2>
